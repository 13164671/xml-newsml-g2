DESCRIPTION
    This module tries to implement the creation of XML files conforming to
    the NewsML-G2 specification as published by the IPTC. It does not aim in
    implementing the complete standard, but in covering the most common use
    cases.

    For the full specification of the format, visit
    http://www.iptc.org/site/News_Exchange_Formats/NewsML-G2/

CURRENT STATUS
    The implementation currently support text items only - no support for
    images, videos, graphics or multimedia packages yet.

    Version 2.9 of the standard is frozen, so the output should not change
    when you update this library. Version 2.12 however is not yet frozen,
    changes in the output are to be expected.
