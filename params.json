It does not aim to\r\nimplement the complete standard, but to cover the most common use cases\r\nin a best-practice manner.\r\n\r\nFor the full specification of the format, visit\r\nhttp://www.newsml-g2.org/. For a quick introduction, you might prefer\r\nthe Quick Start Guides.\r\n\r\n\r\n## GETTING STARTED\r\nTo start, you need to create an instance of the item class of your\r\nchoice, e.g. XML::NewsML_G2::NewsML_G2_Text for a text story, or\r\nXML::NewsML_G2::News_Item_Picture for an image. Each of these classes\r\nmight have some required attributes (e.g. `title', `language',\r\n`provider'), which you will have to provide when creating the instance,\r\nas well as a number of optional ones (e.g. `note'). While for some\r\nattributes scalar values will do, others will require further instances\r\nof classes, e.g. for `provider' you will need an instance of\r\nXML::NewsML_G2::Provider. Please see each class' documentation for\r\ndetails.\r\n\r\nOnce you're done setting up your data structure, you have to create a\r\nwriter instance in order to retrieve your DOM. For simple news items\r\nlike text or picture, XML::NewsML_G2::Writer::News_Item will be the\r\nwriter class to use.\r\n\r\n\r\n## CURRENT STATUS\r\nThe implementation currently supports text, picture, video, audio,\r\ngraphics, as well as multimedia packages and slideshows.\r\n\r\nVersion 2.18 is the latest version of the standard supported by this\r\nsoftware, and should be your first choice. Using versions 2.9, 2.12 and\r\n2.15 is deprecated, and support for it will beremoved in future\r\nreleases.\r\n\r\n\r\n## AUTHORS\r\n*     Philipp Gortan `<philipp.gortan@apa.at>'\r\n*     Mario Paumann `<mario.paumann@apa.at>'\r\n*     Christian Eder `<christian.eder@apa.at>'\r\n*     Stefan Hrdlicka `<stefan.hrdlicka@apa.at>'\r\n\r\n## LICENCE AND COPYRIGHT\r\nCopyright (c) 2013-2014, APA-IT.
